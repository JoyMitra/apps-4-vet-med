Collections are defined by the application as a group of bulls. A use­case for this idea may be considered a day in the field at one ranch. This is an entire collection tied to one Owner. If you switch locations for the day or start collection information for a new Owner, you should create a new collection

Clicking on the Collections & Groups button on the home screen will take you to a list of recent collections and give you the ability to create a new collection. We call this screen the Dashboard. See screenshots below for an illustration.
